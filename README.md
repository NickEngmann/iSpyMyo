This is going to be an ongoing project to add "spy" like elements to work with a Sony Myo
I created a application using a Myo that is able to implement some "spy" actions that I always wanted in real life. 
This phone-hardware application is able to record conversations, create notes, and fake phone calls discretely without 
ever taking out your phone.
This application was created using the backend from the sample HelloWorld project that Myo provides.
From there I added a splash screen, multiple menu options and the various features mentioned.

# Technical Specifics:</br> 
Sony Myo</br>
Developing on Android KitKat (API 19) in Java </br>
